The Client needs to convert a document from RTF format to ASCII format. 
He installs a software that does this woerk.
The software does its work as it calls the method createASCIIText that takes as a 
parameter the document that will be converted. This method calls the concrete builder,
ASCIIConverter, that extends the Builder, TextConverter, and overrides 
its two methods for converting characters and paragraphs, and also the Director, 
RTFReader, that parses the document and calls the builders methods depending on the
type of token encountered. The product, the ASCIIText, is built step by step, 
by appending converted characters.
