A child loves to play with his toys. He has
different types of toys like helicopter, jumping
frog, motion train, frozen charlotte, and a car-dinky.
But he doesnt play with all the toys all the time.
Whenever he gets bored he demands to play with another 
toy to his mother, mother then gives him the toy he
demands.
