A farmer has three dogs, poodle, rottweiler, siberianHusky. 
They bark loudlay whenever they are hungry. It seems to
the farmer tat if they feel hungry they speaks out and 
he gives them food immediately. Farmer just checks
which one is speaking(barking) and provides food to him
whatever food he has right then.
