Maha is a student of class ten and learning to make android apps by taking help from her sister. She is making her own keyboard app for her phone which will allow her to write in English and Bengali language. But for making a better performing app, the configuration should be saved in the app's internal structure once a language is instantiated. So, the second time she needs to use a language, the app will load the configuration from the app's cache rather than reloading the values each time the configuration parameters are used.
