A new software company named Techforce  is looking forward to making a social networking site where people can share their social activities online. Each person will have individual 
profile. People will have to log in using their username and password to access their accounts. Each time they log in, the system automatically restores the previous session of their 
accounts. That is the system will provide the global login access point in all the application components without being necessary to create a whole new session each time a login 
operation is performed.
