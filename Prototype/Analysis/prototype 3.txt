Students of UBC ran a sales analysis on a set of data from database. This year, while doing analysis on a different topic, they figured out that they need the previous year’s set of data. Now, either they can collect the data set the same way they did last year or they can just copy the previous data and go for analysis. Obviously the second option is better for them. So, storage of datasets is very necessary for the students there to lessen extra burden of data collection during analysis.
